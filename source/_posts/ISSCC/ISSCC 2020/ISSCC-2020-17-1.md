## Keypoints

- flicker noise reduction
  - principle
    - enhanced the PN reduction at low power
    - tuning integral path gain to obtain a higher(optimal) frequency zero
  - method
    - proportional (P)- and integral (I)-gain co-optimization (PICO)
      - timing errors are uncorrelated
      - timing error and frequency drift are uncorrelated
  - implementation
    - one-period autocorrelation
    - two-period autocorrelation
- sequence-rearranged optimally spaced TDC

## Notes

- it seems to not break the trade-off of in-band/out-of-band PN supression?
- still limited by the loop stability?
- comparison a fixed or an auto-calibrated integral path gain?

## Background

- detect and correct timing error effectively
  - high-res TDC: large power, limited range
  - BBPD with background optimization [1,2]
    - low power
    - limited error information (with only binary output)
    - proportional gain calibration only
  - parallel BBPDs with optimal spacing
- fundamental limit
  - incorrect assumption that the RDCO jitter was “white” Gaussian
  - ignoring flicker noise
  - optimized only KP

## Proposed

- flicker noise reduction
  - proportional (P)- and integral (I)-gain co-optimization (PICO)
    - obtain more information on timing errors: 7 BBPDs
    - achieve optimal P and I path gain respectively
- sequence-rearranged optimally spaced TDC
  - dynamically switches the order of $\tau_{TH,k}$s mapping to $\tau_{OP,j}$s
  - reduced range requirement and alleviate convergence risk

## Details

- proportional (P)- and integral (I)-gain co-optimization (**PICO**)
  - **theory**
    - integration path: zero of the loop gain
      - optimal: minimum output jitter and a sufficiently wide phase margin
      - smaller: 2nd-order PN-reduction is only valid at low-frequency offsets
      - wider: higher frequency of 2nd-order PN suppression, but the degradation of loop stability causes a severe jitter peaking
  - **principles**
    - timing errors are uncorrelated: $R(\tau[n], \tau[n+1]) = 0$
    - timing error and frequency drift are uncorrelated: $R(f_D[n], \tau[n+1]) = 0$
  - **implementation**: autocorrelation
    - one-period: $E(\tau[n]\cdot \tau[n+1]) = R_\tau[T_{REF}] = 0$ \
      $R\tau(T_{REF})$ = autocorrelation $\tau$ @ $T_{REF}$
    - two-period: $R\tau(T_{REF}) - R\tau(2\cdot T_{REF}) = 0$ \
      $E(f_D[n]·\tau[n+1]) = 0, f_D[n] \propto \tau[n] - \tau[n-1]$
- sequence-rearranged (**SRA**) optimally spaced TDC
  - setup
    - number of TDCs N_TDC = 7: based on behavior simulations to find the minimum achievable σ_RMS
    - The kth BBPD (0 ≤ k ≤ 6) consists of a D-FF and the DTCk that generates $\tau_{TH,k}$
    - the optimal thresholds, $\tau_{OP,j}$, (0 ≤ j ≤ 6) are from the Lloyd-Max algorithm [5]
  - challenges
    - assigning $\tau_{TH,k}$ to $\tau_{OP,k}$ (i.e., j = k) as in [3] is simple, but it increases the required ranges significantly
  - solution
    - the proposed SRA dynamically switches the order of $\tau_{TH,k}$s mapping to $\tau_{OP,j}$s
    - the smallest $\tau_{TH,k}$ is assigned to τOP,0 and the largest $\tau_{TH,k}$ is assigned to $\tau_{OP,6}$
- further extend the loop bandwidth: fast phase-error correction (FPEC) [3]
