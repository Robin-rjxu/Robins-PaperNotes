## Keypoints

- **charge-sharing locking (CSL) technique**
  - principle
    - preset voltage by DAC  
      just like injection-locking reset initial phase
    - sharing the charge for the frequency fine tuning  
      integral path
    - sampling the residual voltage for the coarse freuqency tuning
  - benefits
    - sw-cap: low power, low noise
    - no VCO buffers requirement
    - potential of different inital phases setting → fractional operation
- quadrature class-F oscillator
  - quadrature 3rd-harmonic extraction
  - source-coupling [7]

## Background

- ultra-low jitter 5G mm-wave(mmW) frequency generation
  - sub-sampling (SS)
    - avoid high speed divider
    - high power mmW VCO buffer
    - large area of analog filter
  - injection-locking (IL)
    - suppress the oscillator phase noise
    - cannot ensure robustness over PVT
    - require additional frequency-tracking loop (FTL)
    - timing race between the injection and FTL
    - phase averaging techiniqus [1] : require QVCO
- mm-W oscillator
  - low-Q of sw-cap banks
  - injection pulling by a PA
  - proposed: using a source-coupling [7] quadrature Class-F oscillator

## Proposed

- **charge-sharing locking (CSL) technique**
  - principle
    - implicit digital FTL exploiting a minimalistic SAR-ADC
    - sharing capacitor Cshare (~1pF) shares charge with the resonant LC tank
    - resulting charge residue on Cshare is then sampled for frequency tracking
  - benefits
    - mitigate the timing-race problem
    - the FTL has ultra-low power and tiny area
    - relieves the tough requirements on the resolution
      - a high-speed DSM
      - linearity of sw-cap
- Quadrature class-F oscillator
  - quadrature 3rd-harmonic extraction
  - source-coupling [7]

## Details

- **Charge Sharing Locking (CSL)**
  - setup
    - switches
      - charge-sharing switches: improved bootstarpped
      - the other switches: plain transmission gates
    - waveforms: gate nodes (VG,IP/IN/QP/QN with sinusoidal waveforms)
    - the SAR-ADC-based FTL: runs at 1/4 frequency of reference
  - **operation**
    - **updates the DAC input**
      - clk_csl_2 = 1, preset the expected Vshare1/2 on Cshare1/2
      - clk_csl_2 = 0, preset to the DC offset of VG,IP/IN (i.e. VB of DCO (0.5V))
    - **charge sharing**
      - narrow pulse of clk_csl_1
      - connects Cshare1 (Cshare2) to VG,IP (VG,IN)
      - residual voltages ΔV1 = V_share1 - V_share2 can correct frequency error
    - **error sampling**
      - the charge residue is transferred from Cshare to Csar
      - ΔV2 sampled by ADC equals to Cshare/(Cshare+Csar)ΔV1
      - ΔV2 is used for tuning the fine capacitor bank
      - Csar with charge residue of ΔV2 is reset to 0 after conversion
  - **two-step locking**
    - target
      - solve locking uncertainty
      - avoid locking at the wrong edge
    - operation
      - first, peak/bottom locking
        - set 1/0 to VG,QP/VG,QN respectively
      - then, zero-crossing locking
        - set offset to VG,IP/VG,IN respectively
      - share with clk_csl_2
      - VG,IP is tuned to align with the pulse of clk_csl_1/2
      - steps controlled by a counter
- Quadrature class-F oscillator
  - setup
    - fundemental frequency = 8.75 GHz
    - two harmonic extractors(HEs)
      - signals at drain nodes with a strong 3rd harmonic (~ 30%)
    - The drain tank of the HE
      - amplifies the 3rd harmonic
      - suppresses the fundamental
    - differential tail tank
      - further blocks the fundamental frequency
    - coupling phase delay and coupling strength
      - carefully designed
      - avoid the quadrature uncertainty (+90° or -90°)
