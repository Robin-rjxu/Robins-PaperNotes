## Keypoints

- **analog type-I sampling**
  - challenges
    - limited lockin range
    - condition-dependent phase offset in type-I PLL
  - sampling phase detector (SPD)
  - digital phase error correction (DPEC)
    - accumulate 1-b TDC output
    - when phase offset overloaded
      - a pulse is generated to tune the VCO freuqency and reduce the phase offset
      - the pulase is from the accumulator overflowing carry bit
- **fractional-operation**
  - MMD + DTC dithering
  - sign-LMS for DTC gain calibration
    - digitalized error information from 1-b TDC in DPEC

## Background

- low jitter fractional-N PLL
  - analog
    - not amenable to down scaling
  - digital
    - compact and scalable
    - suffer from quantizaiton noise of the TDC
  - analog type-I PLL with sampling phase detector (SPD)
    - limited range of the SPD
    - tuning-dependent phase error

## Proposed

- factional-N type-I sampling PLL
  - samling phase detector (SPD)
  - digital phase-error-correction (DPEC)
    - limit the SPD phase error without extra quantization error
    - extract a digitized version of the phase error for the accurate the fractional quantization error cancellation

## Details

- **architecture**
  - VCO
    - a singletransconductor Class-C VCO
    - coarse control: digital counter-based frequency-locked loop (FLL)
    - fine control: SPD based type-I analog loop
      - reference clock → slope-control block → sampled by the output of the MMD
  - fractional operation
    - modulus control of the MMD
    - MASH 1-1 DSM
    - DTC in reference path
- **challenges**
  - the phase error information is not readily available in a digital form
  - at the input of PD, different time offsets depending on the locking conditions
  - systematic time offset : the sampling signal (div) always lags the sampled reference clock (refd)
- **solutions**
  - **DPEC**
    - delay the former exactly by Δtos
    - align refd with div
  - **1b TDC**
    - digitize the residual random-noise-induced time difference
    - provides information for DTC gain calibration (sign-LMS)
  - **limited SPD lockin range**
    - The DTC range is deliberately designed to be smaller than the maximum SPD range
      - operation
        - accumulator overflows when the PLL originally locks where the SPD offset is great than the DTC full range
        - a pulse in the cos[k] carry is produced
        - the carry cos[k] is accumulated and retunes the VCO
        - reducing the SPD phase error until Δtos < Tdtc
      - benefits
        - the VCO tuning voltage is automatically constrained within a limited range
        - avoiding the gain compression of both the SPD and the VCO itself
        - keep constant
          - the PLL bandwidth
          - the SPD noise contribution
        - no TDC quantization noise is transferred to the output
