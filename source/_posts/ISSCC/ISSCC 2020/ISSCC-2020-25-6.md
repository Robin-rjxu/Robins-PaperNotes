## Keypoints

- add a high-pass path to suppress the VCO noise, just like injection locking
- sub-sampling operation eliminates the multipication factor of CP noise
- VCO noise is suppressed by the wide loop bandwidth

## Background

- phase noise filter (PNF) [1-3]
*voltage-controlled delay lines (VCDLs) are widely used to extract and suppress the error*
  - [1] large VCDL to yield a more effective noise transfer function (NTF), large power
  - [2] utilize off-chip SAW filter and a passive delay line, inefficient silicon area
  - [3] cascade PLL with a sub-sampling DLL, folds VCDL noise for a large multiplication factor
- spurious tones of the injection-locked PLL

## Proposed

- architecture
  - a conventional type-II PLL
  - a sub-sampling loop with a frequency-shaping sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD)
- SSPD loop
  - high frequency phase error
    - the voltage difference between the current period and the previous period
    - subtracted from each other by a sub-sampling CP (SSCP)
    - **no need for costly and noisy delay lines**
  - error correction
    - the SSCP produces a current to the loop filter (LPF)
  - loop stablization
    - the equivalent $(1-z^{-1})$ operation creates an additional zero to stabilize the PLL loop
    - has negligible effect on the locking characteristic of the PLL
    - wider bandwith for the noise from oscillator

## Details

- in-band noise consideration : kT/C noise of SSPD

$$L_{in-band\ kT/C} = \frac{kT}{C_{SAM} G_{PD}^2 f_{ref}}$$

- system noise consideration
  - sub-sampling operation eliminates the multipication factor of CP noise
  - VCO noise is suppressed by the wide loop bandwidth
- operation mode
  - sampling mode: sample noise in $C_{SAM}$
  - transfer mode: transfer voltage to C1/C2/C3
  - comparing mode: subtraction $VC_1 - VC_2/3$
C2 and C3 work alternatively to store the voltage from the previou period
- open-loop gain : larger than the bandwidth of type-I

$$G_{open} = \left[ \frac{I_P}{2\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{N} + \left( 1- e^{-sT_{ref}}\right) \cdot g_m \cdot G_{PD} \cdot \frac{t_{pul}}{T_{ref}}\right] \cdot LPF(s) \cdot \frac{2\pi K_{VCO}}{s}$$

## Conclusion

**TECH** 40nm \
**REF** 21MHz \
**OUT** 5.25 GHz \
**POWER** 9.1 mW @ 0.9 V \
**RMS JITTER** 1.95 ps \
