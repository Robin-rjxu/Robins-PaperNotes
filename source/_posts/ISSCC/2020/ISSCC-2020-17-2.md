## Keypoints

- **recover frequency information from the BBPD**
  - polarity : main BBPD
  - value: auxiliary BBPD (polarity switching rate = Δf)

- **fractional-n operation**
  - DTC
    - quantization noise : fine resolution 120 fs
    - supply noise / memory effect : replica DTC; dcw retiming
    - linearity : increase fixed capacitance

## Background

- low jitter (<90 fs) and fast lock : analog is preferred over digital implementation
digital bang-bang PLL: less power, smaller area; poor locking performance
- [3] additional FLL to bypass BBPD when overloaded; complexity and power
- [4] enhanced-resolution TDC: not mention locking performance; integer-N only
- fractional-N PLL
  - random jitter from DTC
  - spectrum folding of DTC quantization noise (non-linearity and memory effect) [1]

## Proposed

- **low jitter and fast lock over a wide range**
  - digital frequency-error-recovery (DFER)
    - extracts frequency information directly from the outputs of a main and auxiliary BBPD
      - main BBPD: phase arbitrate
      - auxiliary BBPD: sign and magnitude recovery
      - DFER: pulse generator,
    - average value of the output pulse t[k] is directly proportional to Δf
    - without requiring additional FLLs
  - **DTC with improved linearity and reduced memory effects**

## Details

- **BBPD characteristics**
  - with an inputs of a Δf frequency difference : zero-average periodic output
  - cannot provide accurate frequency information
slow-down or even hinder proper locking
- **DFER**
  - **principle**
    - provide a pulsed output signal, t[k], indicating frequency error Δf
    - average value of t[k] is directly proportional to Δf
    - distinguish between positive and negative Δf by the main BBPD output
    - coarse tuning with DFER output t[k]; fine tuning with the main BBPD output
    - polariy recovery by the main BBPD
  - **main BBPD**
  - **auxiliary BBPD**
    - sampling input delayed by a time tdel
    - simultaneously recover the magnitude and sign of Δf
    - when locked, the auxiliary BBPD, instead, always samples the high level of div, so that its output becomes constant
  - **setup**
    - the auxiliary is placed in parallel to the main one
    - both BBPD outputs are fed to the DFER unit
    - The tdel time shift between ref1 and ref2, which is nominally set to one fourth of the reference period
    - the beat tones at the BBPD outputs are in quadrature with their falling edges leading or lagging one another
    - fine tuning
      - main BBPD output e1[k] is fed to a PI fitler to fine-tune via a ΔΣ-DAC
    - coarse tuning
      - the carry bit from the integrator of the PI filter and DFER output t[k] are accumulated
      - control the coarse banks of the DCO
- **fractional-N operation**
  - a multi-modulus divider (MMD) placed in feedback
  - dithering the modulus control, MC[k]
  - the quantization error is cancelled through a DTC on the reference path
  - DTC
    - loaded by coarse and fine capacitor banks -> res~120fs
    - to reduce supply and memory effect
      - a replica DTC driven with the inverted control code [5]
      - retime control word by a delayed output of the DTC
    - increas amount of the fixed capacitance
    - dummy transisitors
