## Keypoints

- QDAC
  - low-resolution IDAC
  - programmable cap array
  - smooth output frequency change
    - charging Cap with current I
    - compensate the VCO tuning-curve nonlinearity
  - benefits
    - low power
    - low resolution
    - low noise
    - smooth output
- background linearity calibration
  - the IDAC is pre-distorted by a LuT
    - address the entry by the expected frequency
    - updated by the error detected in the SSPD

## Background

- FMCW radars: high-resolution indoor localization and tracking
  - fast saw-tooth FMCW chirp
    - short ramp time
    - large chirp bandwidth (C_BW)
    - high linearity
  - fractionalN phase-locked loop (PLL)
    - two-point-modulation (TPM) [1-3]
      - overcome the bandwidth limitation
    - DTC-based sub-sampling PLL (SSPLL)
      - high-linearity
      - eliminate power-hungry divder
    - modulating (DAC)
      - power consumption imited by the low-noise requirements
      - high gain, very-sensitive tuning input of the VCO
  - conventional VDAC
    - output stepped voltage
    - require high resolution
    - generates wideband noise
      - sized with a small load resistance (around 50Ω)
      - to limit the up-conversion to phase noise by the high gain of the VCO
      - cannot Increase the C_tune for a similar noise-filtering
        - directly impacts the settling time of the frequency step

## Proposed

- charge-integrating DAC (QDAC)
  - low-power
  - low-resolution
    - does not need a LSB size small enough to limit the quantization noise
    - only needs a limited number of bits to compensate for the VCO tuning-curve nonlinearity
  - continuous-time
  - superior noise performance
  - generate a smooth output frequency change
    - attenuates the signal replicas due to a stepped frequency change
- background calibration algorithm
  - calibrate the nonlinearity of the highpass modulation path
  - fast convergence

## Details

- **architecture**
  - linear ramp modulation
    - highpass injection path using the QDAC
    - the lowpass injection path using the DTC
    - chirp slope
      - The FMCW controller defines the charging and reset time of the QDAC capacitor C_tune
  - auxiliary FLL
    - receive the frequency modulation data
    - avoid the false triggering of the dead zone (DZ)
  - background calibraion
- **operation**
  - voltage ramp on Vtune2
    - closing the switch S_ramp
    - opening the switch S_reset
    - \ a charge from the QDAC is integrated on to the capacitor C_tune
      - start: from a non-zero voltage V_reset
      - end: V_tune2 is reset to Vreset and the SSPLL re-acquires lock
    - linear environment
      - the QDAC input code is fixed
      - the VCO output frequency smoothly increases over time
      - great noise performance
        - generates noise but at lower frequencies
        - suppressed by the PLL loop
- **implementation**
  - **QDAC**
    - core 10b current DAC (IDAC)
      - segmented current-steering DAC architecture
        - 5b binary for LSB
        - 5b thermometric for MSB
        - output is mirrored with a programmable gain
    - a programmable capacitor array (C_tune)
    - the chirp slope is defined by the ratio of mean IDAC output current (IQDAC) and Ctune
    - the chirp starts from a non-zero voltage V_reset
  - **background linearity calibration**
    - the modulation data to the IDAC is pre-distorted by a LuT
    - the expected output frequency is used to address the appropriate LuT entry
    - The LuT is populated based on the correlation of error detected in the SSPD with the modulation data (Sign1)
    - procedure
      - background monitoring: based on Sign1
      - empty LuT : informartion from FLL
      - initial calibration: update LuT with Sign1
      - larger frequency errors
        - activate FLL
        - update LuT with Sign2
        - restart chirp
