## Keypoints

- self-calibrated 2b PD
  - $dt1 = T_0 + Δ - T_P$
  - $dt2 = T_0 - T_P$
  - if sign(dt1) = sign(dt2), the error caused by $T_P$; or the error is caused by $\Delta$
  - when sign(dt1) = sign(dt2), adjust $T_P$; or adjust T_DCO to cancel $\Delta$

## Background

- ROSC (Ring Oscillator) : fully synthesizable design
- challenges
  - insensitive to layout parasitics and mismatches
  - worse in fracional-n architecture: stringent gain and linearity requirement of DTC and TDC
  - synthesized blocks are sensitive to PVT variations

## Proprosed

- **2b time period comparison (TPC)** : no additional/initial calibration, fast locking
  - tunable reference delay $T_P$
  - 2b phase detector (PD)
  - adjusts the DCO period $T_{DCO}$ and $T_P$ using two independent feedback loops operating simultaneously
  - automatic tuning of $T_{DCO}$ and $T_P$ without additional calibration (CA)
- **fractional-N generation**
  - a replica of the DCO to implement the DTC \

## Details

- **2b PD**
  - **operation**
    - compare MDLL output CK_i and its delayed output $CK_{id}$ ( $CK_i --- T_P ---> CK_{id}$ )
    - the injection can cause an error (deterministic jitter) $\Delta$ ($\Delta = N·T_0 - T_{ref}$ -> actual-desired)
      - postive $\Delta$ -> lower $T_{DCO}$
      - $dt1 = 1st\ CK_{id} - 2nd\ CK_i = T_0 + \Delta - T_P$
      *affected by the injection*
      - $dt2 = 2nd\ CK_{id} - 3rd\ CK_i = T_0 - T_P$
      *no effect of injection*
      - when sign(dt1) = sign(dt2), adjust $T_P$; or adjust $T_{DCO}$ to cancel $\Delta$
      *if sign(dt1) = sign(dt2), the error caused by $T_P$; or the error is caused by $\Delta$*
      - eventually, T_P and T_DCO both converge to T (where $T=T_{ref}/N$), cancelling $\Delta$ completely
    - offset in the PD gets absorbed inside $T_P$
  - **two loops**
  *for $T_P$ and $T_{DCO}$ respectively*
    - both loops operate simultaneously
    - the one having worse resolution updates more frequently limiting the overall performance
  - **resolution**
    - $T_P$ resolution is 0.2ps/LSB
    - $T_{DCO}$ resolution is 54fs/LSB at 3.6GHz
    - translates to a $\Delta$ correction resolution of 0.24ps/LSB -> -61 dBc ref spur
- **fractional-n**
  - **coarse DTC**
    - replicates the 5-stage DCO and shares the same delay control bits to achieve the resolution of 0.2T
    - its delay is set by the MUX selections
  - **fine DTC**
    - 7b phase interpolator (PI) based the fine DTC
    - the output of the 2nd and 4th stages of the coarse DTC
    - delay step : 0.2T/$2^7$
  - **gain calibration**
    - mismatches between DTC and DCO are compensated by the DTC-gain-correction loop
- **implementation**
  - clock-gating circuit generates $CK_i$ from $CK_{out}$ by sampling the DTC output (Ref_early) to create the enable signal X
  - the 2b PD contains 4 D-flip-flops (FF_0-3) and generates controlling bits $D_{tune}$ and $F_{tune}$
  - DTC gain tuning
    - detect the time instance when the DTC reaches the maximum delay and resets to the initial value
    - the overflow of $F_{coarse}$ generates the clock $CK_{frac}$
    - $CK_{frac}$ samples and accumulates the error in $F_{tune}$
