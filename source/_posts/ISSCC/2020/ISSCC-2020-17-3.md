## Keypoints

- mechanism
  - non-lineariy $f_{DTC}(D_{DCW})$ + time-variante $PDF(D_{DCW})$
    - time-variant expected value of error: $E(\tau_{DTC})$
    - → spurs in the $PSD(\tau_{DTC})$
  - time-invarient $PDF(D_{DCW})$
    - even with non-linearity $f_{DTC}(D_{DCW})$
    - → time-invarient $PDF(\tau_{DTC})$
    - → no spurs in the $PSD(\tau_{DTC})$
- modulating $D_{DCW}$
  - use two split DTCs to achieve $D_{AQ} = D_{DCW,D} – D_{DCW,R}$
  - modulate the two DTCs with URNs
  - achieve time-invariant $PDF(\tau_{DTC})$

## Background

- RO-DPLLs have difficulty of low phase noise and high-frequency resolution
  - DSM-based fractional-N operation
    - hard to achieve low-PN
  - DTC quantization noise cancellation
    - sensitive to no-nlinearity → fractional spurs
    - improve linearity
      - pre-distorting $D_{DCW}$ → design complexity
      - successive requantizer (SA) instead of a DSM → large dynamic range of DTC
- spur theory
  - constant signal $E[X](t)$ over time → $PSD(X)$ has no spurious tones

## Proposed

- time-invariant probability modulator (TIPM)
  - theory
    - if the expected value of signal $X$, $E[X](t)$, is constant over time
    - the power spectral density (PSD) of $X$ shows no spurious tones
  - principles
    - modulate $D_{DCW}$ before it interacts with the DTC nonlinearity
    - obtain a time-invarient PDF and constant $E[\tau_{DTC}](t)$
  - operation
    - convert the accumulated DSΜ code $D_{AQ}$ to $D_{DCW}$

## Details

- theory analysis
  - how does non-linearity function ($f_{DTC}$) cause spurs
    - $E[D_{DCW}](t)$ is constant over time
      - in frequency domain, $PSD[D_{DCW}]$ has no spurs
      - in time domain, $PDF[D_{DCW}]$ varies with time
      - probability of $D_{DCW}$ for the kth bin, $P[D_{DCW,k}]$ varies like an impulse train
    - $\tau_{DTC}$ must have some periodicity in $PSD[\tau_{DTC}]$
  - idea
    - $D_{DCW}$ can be modulated to have a time-invariant $PDF[D_{DCW}]$
    - $\tau_{DTC}$ can have a constant $E[\tau_{DTC}](t)$
    - irrespective of the characteristics of $f_{DTC}(D_{DCW})$
    - The time-invariant property is preserved even after passing nonlinear distortions
- implementation
  - two DTCs, splits $D_{AQ}$ into two $D_{DCW}s: D_{DCW,D}$ and $D_{DCW,R}$
    - control $DTC_D$ and $DTC_R$ respectively
    - make $PDF[D_{DCW},D]$ and $PDF[D_{DCW},R]$ time-invariant
    - removing the Q-noise by maintaining $D_{AQ} = D_{DCW,D} – D_{DCW,R}$
  - modulation
    - using uniform random numbers (URNs) unrelated $D_{AQ}$
  - DTC-gain controller
    - using an LMS algorithm calibrates the two DTCs individually
  - loop noise
    - optimal-threshold TDC
    - \ a loop-gain controller
