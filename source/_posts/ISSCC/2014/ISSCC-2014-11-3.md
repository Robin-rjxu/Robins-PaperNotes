## Keypoints

- LSB-first successive approximation (SA)
  - INIT Phase
    - set the DAC to the initial geuess of D_PREV
    - get the biecycling DIR by the first comparison
  - toMSB Phase
    - start from the lowest bit = inv(DIR)
  - toLSB Phase
    - conventional SAR logic
  - efficiency
    - number of bitcycle: best 2; worst 2N+1
    - save energy during periods of low signal activity

## Background

- ADCs used in medical and industrial monitoring
  - signal pattern
    - short bursts of high activity
    - long idle periods
  - current approaches to save energy
    - variable resolution and sample rate systems
    - asynchronous level-crossing ADCs

## Proposed

- LSB-first successive approximation (SA)
  - signal-activity-based power-saving algorithm
  - targeted at signals with low average activity
  - benefits
    - maintains a constant sample rate and resolution
    - scales logarithmically with signal activity
    - not inherently suffer from slope overload
    - fewer bitcycle → reduced power

## Details

- implementation
  - 10b capacitive DAC
    - 5b main DAC
    - coupled a 5b sub-DAC with the capacitor Cc  
      bridged capictor Cc
    - 2-stage dynamic comparator
    - bootstrapped switch (charge pump)
    - long tansistor length to reduce leakage
- number of bitcyles (N bits resolution)
  - best : 2
  - worst: 2N+1
- operation
  - starts with an initial guess D_PREV (error = Δcode)
  - bit-cycles that determine the LSBs of D first
  - phases
    - INIT Phase
      - sample
      - set the DAC to the initial geuess of D_PREV
      - get the biecycling DIR by the first comparison
        - cmp = 0, DIR = 1, D_RREV is smaller, increase
        - cmp = 1, DIR = 0, D_PREV is larger, decrease (from MSBs) (to LSBs)
    - toMSB Phase  
      (from LSBs)
      - start from the lowest bit = inv(DIR)  
        Q = index( lowest_bit == inv (DIR) )
      - skip the bits == DIR already
      - until VDAC overshoot VIN  
        the comparator output flips
    - toLSB Phase  
      (from MSBs)
      - start from the end of toMSB Phase
      - conventional SAR logic
      - handle both polarities of DIR
    - end
      - DACs are purged
  - fast fullscale signal (even beyond Fs)
    - an initial guess of 511 rather than D_PREV is used to limit the maximum error
- power saving dependence
  - the mean Δcode
  - signal's power probability density
