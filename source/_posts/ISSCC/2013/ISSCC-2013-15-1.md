## Keypoints

- **zoom ADC architecture (2-step)**
  - setup
    - 6b coarse SAR conversion
    - fine delta-sigma conversion
  - principle
    - coarse conversion of the SAR ADC first

    - 6b coarse SAR conversion
    - fine delta-sigma conversion
    - 2x input range of the fine conversion
      - avoid the overflow
      - ensure the stability of the 2nd-order modulator
  - principle
    - coarse conversion of the SAR ADC first
    - fine delta-sigma then continues to digitized the input

  - inverter-based amplifier
  - auto-zero process
  - dynamic bias for high DC gain

## Details

- **zoom ADC architecture**
  - *6b coarse SAR conversio*n*
    - principle
      - $k · V_{LSB,SAR} < V_i < (k+1) · V_{LSB,SAR}$
    - non-idealities and quantization error
      - cause out-of-range errors of the fine conversion
  - **fine delta-sigma conversion**
    - principle
      - $V_i$ can then be accurately digitized by a 2nd-order single-bit ΔΣ ADC
      - the references are set to $k · V_{LSB, SAR}$ and $(k+1) · V_{LSB, SAR}$
    - non-idealities
      - **input range overflow**
        - from SAR ADC
        - operation
          - comparing $V_i$ to $(k+0.5) · V_{LSB, SAR}$
          - chosen conversion range is then either from $(k-1)$ to $(k+1)$ or from $k$ to $(k+2)$ depending on the results
          - ensures that $V_i$ is always in the 2nd-order modulator’s stable input range
        - process only the quanization error of the SAR ADC
          - DC-gain, output swing and settling requirements are greatly relaxed
      - **conversion range**
        - sample VREF
        - using an appropriate sub-set of the Cap-DAC’s elements
      - **offset and 1/f noise**
        - both integrators are auto-zeroed
        - chopped at system-level
          - averaging the results of two conversions,
          - each with a different input polarity
      - **linearity**
        - not limited by one-bit quantization
        - limited by the mismatch of the Cap-DAC's unit elements
        - mitigated by applying cyclic dynamic element matching (DEM)
    - implementaion
      - feedforward
      - single-bit
      - 2nd-order
      - sinc^2 decimation filter
      - loop filter
        - two switched-capacitor (SC) integrators
        - half clock-cycle delays
- **inverter-based integrator**
  - implementation
    - pseudo-differential inverter-based amplifier
      - a cascoded inverter
      - **dynamically biased to enhance its immunity to PVT**
        - sampling phase
          - auto-zeroing process
          - cancels the inverter’s offset and 1/f noise
          - reducing the inverter’s noise bandwidth for the increased thermal noise near DC
        - integration phase
          - disconnects the inverter from the floating current source
          - reconfigures it as a high-gain push-pull common-source amplifier
          - DC gains greater than 80dB
    - 64-cell Cap-DAC
    - offset-storage capcitor $C_C$
  - operation
    - phase φ1
      - sampling on the Cap-DAC
      - configure 1st integrator for unity-gain and auto-zeroed
    - phase φ2
      - integration
        - transfers an amount of charge proportional to $in ± m/64·V_{ref}$
        - into the integration capacitor $C_I$
    - coarse converstion
      - the 1st integrator is reset at the start of each SAR comparison step
      - the resulting output is directly routed to the quantizer
    - fine conversion
      - the integrator’s output is coupled to the quantizer
      - via the rest of the ΔΣ modulator’s loop filter
