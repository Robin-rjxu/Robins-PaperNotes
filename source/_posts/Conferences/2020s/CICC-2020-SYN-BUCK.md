## Keypoints

  - flexible precision feedback loop
    - high-precision low-frequency mode
    - low-precision high-frequency mode
  - fully synthesized generation
    - pcell + macro + auto PR
    - design space exploration and reduced sets

## Background

  - inductive voltage regulator (IVR)
    - for fine-grain power management
    - fast dynamic voltage scaling
    - reduce power noise
    - reduce complexity by synthesizable loop

## Details

  - flexible precision feedback loop
    - high-precision low-frequency mode (6b, 2xFSW)
    - low-precision high-frequency mode (4b, 4xFSW)
  - synthesizable blocks
    - ADC
      - input voltage controlled delay line and latch
      - count the number of ones
      - re-configure to different precision and frequency
        - different pulse width
        - restrict the number of stages
        - bit shedding
    - DPWM
      - tri-state buffers and DLL
      - a mux selects phases by the compensators
  - on-chip autotuning engine
    - use a cost metric summing aggregated absolute error values
  - auto-generation tool
    - power stage: multiple custom pcells
    - loop: standard cell based synthesis
    - top: automated place and route; coupled back/front-end optimization
    - mixed-signal design space exploration
      - extend design space: IRV, controller, RTL, physical design, including digital parameters
      - reduce set: timing closure, target settling time, defined constraints
