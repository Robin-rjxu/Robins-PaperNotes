## Keypoints

- multi-tap finite-impulse response (FIR) adaptive filter
  - accurately replicate in the digital domain the PLL loop filter
  - extract the equivalent gain of the VCO-divider-BPD chain
    g = N KT Kbpd
  - loop-gain normalization
- FIR coefficients estimation
  - replicate the oscillator via an digital integrator
    from q[k] the integrated training sequence, s[k]
  - digitally-tunable FIR filtere stimating the analog LPF TF
- adaptive filter algorithm : 16 taps
  mimic the DLF output {input},  goes through PLL and get PD output e[k] {input}
  - input : s[k], integrated QE q[k] of the DSM for DCO
  - filter result :  the FIR TF g
  - output : q[k] x g
  - error : p[k], PLL output e[k] subtract FIR output q[k] x g
  - tap number is sized
    - slowest filter time constant
    - the reference period

## Background

- BB DPLL
  - achieving state-of-the-art phase noise, jitter
  - fast-lock performances
  - bandwidth
    - is subject to PVT variations
    - depends on the system phase noise level
- previously presented ABWC systems
  - the PLL requires a narrow bandwidth
    - aggressive out-of-band filtering 
    - to meet the spectral phase noise mask
- a narrow-band loop filter in BB DPLL
  - would significantly alter the transfer function
    from q[k] (used as LMS training sequence) to the BPD output, e[k]
  - impairing the DPLL bandwidth regulation
