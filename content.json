RMS jitter and reference spur can be significantly degraded by drifted frequency very difficult to reduce the level of the spur sufficiently for a high N requirements higher data rates even more stringent peak-to-peak jitte minimize reference spur level precise and versatile background calibrator removes all three root causes of f_ERR frequency drift due to voltage and temperature

continuously in the background Proposed ring-VCO-based ILCM can achieve a low-reference spur and low-RMS jitter with a background triple-point frequency/phase/slope calibrator (TP-FPSC) Details Principle three roots causes of frequency error frequency drift conventional frequency calibrators failed to completely remove f_DF limited accuracy of the calibration mismatches of the delay cells input offsets of a PD mismatches of differential signal paths phase offset causes systematic errors the calibrator reacts as if this phase error was generated due to f_DF tune f_VCO to reduce the phase error results in the generation of f_ERR existing improvements pulse-gating technique use additional calibrating circuits slope modulation the change in SL_INJ changes the propagation delay of an inverter chain [31] ultimately causing the phase error in φPD [1] conventional frequency calibrator reacts to generate more f_ERR Architecture a five-stage ring VCO the proposed TP-FPSC voltagecontrolled delay line (VCDL) bang-bang PD (BBPD) a multi-control voltage (VC) generator (MVG) generates three independent VCs delivered to a different target circuit for the three calibration mechanisms VC1 is used for the VCO to make fVCO close to N · fREF VC2 is used for the VCDL to cancel the phase offset from any systematic errors VC3 is used for the slope controller to equalize the slopes of SOUT three D-flip-flops (DFFs) to sample PDOUT from the PD sequentially extracted error information from the same output analog accumulator (A-ACC) all three VCj s are updated concurrently during a short pulse PSUD enhance the resolution just by decreasing the pulsewidth of PSUD Operation Three Error Detection Mechanisms of the TP-FPSC frequency drift when the first rising edges of SOUT and SVCDL or the second rising edges of SOUT and SVCDL are compared by the PD phase offset φPD becomes constant for all rising edges of SOUT and SVCDL after fERR calibration is done use FE4 to sample PDOUT, which generates DER2 slope modulation after the two foregoing calibrations are done detected by sampling PDOUT by FE2 bandwidth design the three calibrating loops were designed to have different bandwidth (settling speeds) of VC1,2,3 largest BW of frequenc calibrator to suppress the flicker noise of the VCO BW of the phase-offset calibration was ten times smaller than that of the

the variation in the jitter at the input each moment Limitation the bandwidths of the three calibrators are limited by the loop stability and the detection sequence frequency drift cancelled first,
